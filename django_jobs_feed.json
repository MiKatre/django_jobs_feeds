Unlike most \"early-stage\" startups, we are already at £100k ARR, growing month-on-month and have investment from angels. We have a product customers love, a validated business model, and we are now preparing to expand to Airbnb and Expedia. We are a lean team of two founders looking for a Founding Engineer. You will be the technical lead, working directly with us to brainstorm ideas, architecture and ship code quickly. The Role This is a Backend-First role (70/30 split). You will spend most of your time in Python/Django, but you must be willing to jump into React/Tailwind to ship complete features ‍ We have interesting technical challenges involving high-volume data and browser automation (MCP/AI) Scale the Backend: Build and ship features using Python (Django) and Postgres. High-Volume Scraping: Manage enterprise-level scraping (1,000s of requests/second) and reverse-engineering of public data sources. Chrome Extension: Maintain and expand our extension that bridges our platform with customer accounts. Ship Fast: We use ChatGPT/Copilot heavily to speed up boilerplate code so we can focus on the complex logic. Frontend (Light): We use React/Tailwind. You don't need to be a frontend expert, but you should be willing to jump in and tweak UI when needed. The Logistics One founder is in Leeds, the other in London. We'd like to meet up occasionally to brainstorm & speed up onboarding as well in person. Salary: £70k - £90k (depending on experience). Equity: Up to 2% options (4-year vesting). We are aiming for a £5-10m valuation in our next raise, join now to get in at the ground floor. Who You Are A Builder: You have startup experience (founder or early employee). You care about solving problems, not just writing code. Python Expert: You have deep experience with Python. Data Scraper: You understand the nuances of web scraping, proxies, and browser automation (Playwright). Pragmatic: You know when to build for scale and when to ship a \"hacky\" fix to unblock a customer. Autonomy: You want direct responsibility. You hate micromanagement and love taking a ticket from \"idea\" to \"deployed.\" Interview process - 30 min non technical call with myself. - 1 hour technical pair programming challenge (not leetcode but real-life problems) - Meet up in person with both founders - Offer Why This Role? Real Revenue: We aren't just an MVP, we have customers who have been with us for months earning more revenue with 0% churn. High Equity: 2% is a good chunk for our stage, it should be worth a significant amount within a years time as we raise at higher valuations. Hard Problems: If you get bored building standard CRUD apps, our scraping, MCP & automation challenges will keep you engaged.
